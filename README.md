# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a simple data science project that predicts house prices based on their size (square feet).  
It uses **Linear Regression** from `scikit-learn` and visualizes the data with `matplotlib`.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses Python libraries: **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**
- Predicts house prices based on training data
- Displays a clean graph of actual vs predicted prices
